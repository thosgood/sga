  Let <tex>X</tex> be a prescheme over <tex>Y</tex>, and <tex>\Delta _{X/Y}</tex> the diagonal morphism <tex>X \to  X \times _Y X</tex>.
  This is an immersion, and thus a closed immersion of <tex>X</tex> into an open subset <tex>V</tex> of <tex>X \times _Y X</tex>.
  Let <tex>\mathscr {I}_X</tex> be the ideal of the closed sub-prescheme corresponding to the diagonal in <tex>V</tex> (N.B. if one really wishes to do things intrinsically, without assuming that <tex>X</tex> is separated over <tex>Y</tex> — a misleading hypothesis — then one should consider the set-theoretic inverse image of <tex>\mathcal {O}_{X \times  X}</tex> in <tex>X</tex> and denote by <tex>\mathscr {I}_X</tex> the augmentation ideal in the above ...).
  The sheaf <tex>\mathscr {I}_X/ \mathscr {I}_X^2</tex> can be thought of as a quasi-coherent sheaf on <tex>X</tex>, which we denote by <tex>\Omega _{X/Y}^1</tex>.
  This sheaf is of finite type if <tex>X \to  Y</tex> is of finite type, and it behaves well with respect to a base change <tex>Y' \to  Y</tex>.
  We also introduce the sheaves <tex>\mathcal {O}_{X \times _Y X}/ \mathscr {I}_X^{n+1}= \mathscr {P}^n_{X/Y}</tex>, which are sheaves of <em>rings</em> on <tex>X</tex>, giving us preschemes denoted by <tex>\Delta _{X/Y}^n</tex> and called the <em><tex>n</tex>-th infinitesimal neighbourhood of <tex>X/Y</tex></em>.
  The polysyllogism is entirely trivial, even if rather long (cf. EGA IV 16.3);
  it seems wise to not discuss it until we use it for something helpful, with smooth morphisms.

  To simplify the exposition, we assume that all preschemes in the following are locally Noetherian (at least, starting from <ref addr="sga-1.i.2" href="sga-1.i.2.xml"/>).

    Let <tex>A \to  B</tex> be a local homomorphism (N.B. all rings are now Noetherian), and let <tex>\mathfrak {m}</tex> be the maximal ideal of <tex>A</tex>.
    Then the following conditions are equivalent:
  </p><ol><li><tex>B/ \mathfrak {m}B</tex> is of finite dimension over <tex>k=A/ \mathfrak {m}</tex>.
    </li>
    <li><tex>\mathfrak {m}B</tex> is an ideal of definition, and <tex>B/ \mathfrak {r}(B)=k(B)</tex> is an extension of <tex>k=k(A)</tex>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The completion <tex>\widehat {B}</tex> of <tex>B</tex> is finite over the completion <tex>\widehat {A}</tex> of <tex>A</tex>.

  If the conditions of <ref addr="sga-1.i.2.1" href="sga-1.i.2.1.xml" taxon="Proposition"/> are satisfied, then we say that <tex>B</tex> is <em>quasi-finite</em> over <tex>A</tex>.
  A morphism <tex>f \colon  X \to  Y</tex> is said to be quasi-finite at <tex>x</tex> (or the <tex>Y</tex>-prescheme <tex>f</tex> is said to be quasi-finite at <tex>x</tex>) if <tex>\mathcal {O}_x</tex> is quasi-finite over <tex>\mathcal {O}_{f(x)}</tex>.
  This is equivalent to saying that <tex>x</tex> is <em>isolated in its fibre <tex>f^{-1}(x)</tex></em>.
  A morphism is said to be quasi-finite if it is quasi-finite at each point.
  (In [EGA II 6.2.3] we further suppose that <tex>f</tex> is of finite type.)

    If <tex>A</tex> is complete, then quasi-finiteness is equivalent to finiteness.

  We could also give the usual polysyllogism (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) for quasi-finite morphisms, but that doesn't seem necessary here.
