## 2. Some smoothness criteria for morphisms {#II.2}

::: {.itenv #II.2.1 title="Theorem 2.1" latex="{Theorem 2.1}"}
Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a morphism locally of finite type, and let $x\in X$ and $y=f(x)$.
For $f$ to be smooth at $x$, it is necessary and sufficient that

a. $f$ be flat at $x$, and
b. $f^{-1}(y)$ be smooth over $k(y)$ at $x$.
:::

::: {.proof}
Since the composite of two flat morphisms is flat, and since $Y[t_1,\ldots,t_n]\to Y$ is a flat morphism, we see that smooth implies flat;
taking [1.3, (ii)](#II.1.3) into account, this proves necessity.
Now suppose that (a) and (b) are satisfied, and let $V$ be an affine neighbourhood of $y$ of ring $A$, and $U$ an affine neighbourhood of $x$ over $V$ of ring $B$.
Taking $U$ to be small enough, we can suppose, by (b), that there exists an *étale* $k(y)$-morphism
$$
  g\colon U|f^{-1}(y)
  \to \Spec k[t_1,\ldots,t_n]
  \qquad\text{(where }k=k(y)\text{)}
$$
defined by $n$ sections $g_i$ of the structure sheaf of $U|f^{-1}(y)$.
We easily note that we can suppose the $g_i$ (which are a priori elements of $B\otimes_A k=BS^{-1}$, where $S=A\setminus\frak{p}$, with $\frak{p}$ the prime ideal of $A$ corresponding to $y$) to come from sections of the structure sheaf of $U$, so that $g$ is induced by a morphism, also denoted by $g$,
$$
  g\colon U
  \to Y[t_1,\ldots,t_n]
$$
(after possibly multiplying the $g_i$ by a single non-zero element of $k$).
But $U$ is flat over $Y$ by (a), and so too is $Y[t_1,\ldots,t_n]$;
we also know that $g$ induces an étale morphism between the fibres over $y$, and so $g$ is étale at $x$ by [I 5.8](#I.5.8).

Let $S$ be a prescheme, and let $f\colon X\to Y$ an $S$-morphism of finite type, with $Y$ of finite type and flat over $S$.
Let $x\in X$, and let $s$ be the projection of $x$ to $S$.
For $f$ to be smooth at $x$, it is necessary and sufficient that $X$ be flat (or smooth) over $S$ at $x$, and that the induced morphism $f_s\colon X_s\to Y_s$ between the fibres over $s$ be smooth at $x$.
:::

::: {.proof}
Only the sufficiency needs proving, and this follows from [2.1](#II.2.1), combined with the flatness criterion [I 5.9](#I.5.9).

To state the following result, "recall" that a morphism $f\colon X\to Y$ locally of finite type is said to be *equidimensional* at the point $x\in X$ if (setting $y=f(x)$) we can find an open neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ of which every component dominates a component of $Y$ such that, for all $y'\in Y$, the irreducible components of $f^{-1}(y')\cap U$ all have the same dimension, independent of $y$.
It suffices, in this condition, to take $y'$ to be the generic points of the irreducible components of $Y$ passing through $y$, *and* the point $y$ itself.
If, for example, $X$ and $Y$ are integral and $f$ is dominant, then the condition implies that the components of the $f^{-1}(y)$ passing through $x$ have "the good" dimension, i.e. the dimension of the generic fibre (recall that they are always $\geq$ the dimension of the generic fibre).
If $f$ is equidimensional at $x$, with the dimension of its fibre at $x$ being $n$, and if $g\colon U\to Y'=Y[t_1,\ldots,t_n]$ is a $Y$-morphism on a neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ that induces a morphism on the fibres of $y$ that is quasi-finite at $x$ (or, equivalently, if $g$ is quasi-finite at $x$), then we can show that every irreducible component of $U$ passing through $x$ dominates an irreducible component of $Y'$.
By the "normalisation lemma", such a $g$ always exists (and, conversely, if there exists a quasi-finite $Y$-morphism $g$ on an open neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ into a $Y$-scheme of the form $Y'=Y[t_1,\ldots,t_n]$ such that every component of $U$ passing through $x$ dominates a component of $Y'$, then $f$ is equidimensional at $x$).
Then:

::: {.itenv #II.2.3 title="Proposition 2.3" latex="{Proposition 2.3}"}
Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a morphism locally of finite type, and let $x\in X$, and $y=f(x)$.
Suppose that $\cal{O}_y$ is normal.
For $f$ to be smooth at $x$, it is necessary and sufficient that $f$ be equidimensional at $x$, and that $f^{-1}(y)$ be smooth over $k(y)$ at $x$.
:::

::: {.proof}
We immediately see from the definition that a smooth morphism is equidimensional (N.B. a flat morphism of finite type is not necessary equidimensional at $x$, even if its fibre at $x$ is irreducible).
Let us prove the converse.
Since $f^{-1}(y)$ is smooth over $k(y)$ at $x$, we can suppose (by replacing, if necessary, $X$ by a suitable neighbourhood of $x$) that there exists a $Y$-morphism
$$
  g\colon X\to Y[t_1,\ldots,t_n] = Y'
$$
that induces an étale morphism on the fibres of $y$, and is a fortiori quasi-finite at $x$.
Thus $g$ is unramified, and (since $f$ is equidimensional at $x$) the irreducible components of $X$ that contain $x$ each dominate a component of $Y'$, and a fortiori the homomorphism $\cal{O}_{y'}\to\cal{O}_x$ induced by $g$ (where $y'=g(x)$) is *injective*.
This homomorphism is also unramified, and $\cal{O}_{y'}$ is normal since it is the localisation of the ring $\cal{O}_y[t_1,\ldots,t_n]$, which is itself normal since $\cal{O}_y$ is.
Thus the homomorphism $\cal{O}_{y'}\to\cal{O}_x$ is étale [I 9.5 (ii)](#I.9.5).
